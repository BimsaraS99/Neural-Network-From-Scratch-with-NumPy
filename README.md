# Neural Network from Scratch for Digit Recognition

## Introduction to the Project

This repository contains the implementation of a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy for digit recognition. The neural network architecture consists of one hidden layer with ReLU activation and an output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

In the `ann_no_packages.ipynb` notebook, include the code for building a neural network with 784 input layer neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 10 neuron output layer for 10 classes. In the `my_note.md` and `my_note.pdf`, include all the notes that were built while learning the mathematics behind neural networks. The purpose of this project is to unravel the mathematics behind deep learning. To set up the project on your local environment, please refer to the `setup.md` file. This file contains instructions on how to configure the necessary dependencies and environment settings to run the project locally.

## What is Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks, such as the human brain. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers. These networks can learn to perform tasks by adjusting the connections between neurons based on input data.
